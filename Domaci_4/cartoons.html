			<p>Glenn John McQueen (December 24, 1960 - October 29, 2002) was a Canadian supervisor of digital animation and supervising character animator at Pixar and PDI.</p>
			<p>McQueen graduated from Canada's renowned Sheridan College in 1985. He was sent by Sheridan on a scholarship to the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab, where he worked as head of the 3-D production department, which made film effects, TV commercials and scientific visuals.<br/>
			In 1994 he moved to Pixar Animation Studios (partly due to his interest in Toy Story and his respect for John Lasseter), where he supervised the animation on Pixar's early successes, including Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc.</p>
			<p>His last name is named after Lightning McQueen, the protagonist of Cars and the deuteragonist of Cars 2.</p><hr/>
