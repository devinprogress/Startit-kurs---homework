	<h1>Like a Rolling Stone</h1>

	<!--Dodati prvu strofu-->
	
	<p>You've gone to the finest school all right, <em>Miss Lonely</em><br/>
	   But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br/>
       And <strong>nobody's</strong> ever taught you how to live out on the street<br/>
       And now you're gonna <strong>have to</strong> get used to it</p>

	<p>You said you'd never <em>compromise</em><br/>
       With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br/>
       He's not selling any alibis<br/>
       As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br/>
       And say do you want to make a deal?</p>

    <p>How does it feel?<br/>
       <strong>How does it feel?</strong><br/>
       To be on your own<br/>
       With no direction home<br/>
       A complete unknown<br/>
       Like a rolling stone?</p>
